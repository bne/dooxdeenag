## some explanation

I have sat for hours trying to think of something witty to write in greeting cards; Now I don't have to, I can get a computer to do it.

Select the options and click GO. The request is sent to the completions API at <a href="https://beta.openai.com/">OpenAI</a> and some inspiration is sent back.

The tagline, domain name and copy for the home page have been generated by <a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3">the text-davinci-002 GPT-3 model</a>.

The favicon, logo, and elks were generated by <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALLÂ·E</a>.

I did consider getting an algorithm to write this bit.

Maybe it did.

## dev

    python3 -m http.server --directory web-client/
